#Bilateral facial paralysis

Facial paralysis can be an extremely debilitating disorder.

##Bilateral facial paralysis is a rare condition that is unusual in the neurosurgical literature.

Its incidence is one case per 5 million population per year, when compared to unilateral facial paralysis with 1,000 cases per 5 million population per year. The causes of bilateral facial paralysis range from infections, tumors, head injuries, degenerative diseases, vascular diseases etc. Head injuries is responsible for about 5 per cent of all cases facial paralysis. Temporal bone fracture is a well-known cause of facial paralysis, and is responsible for approximately 3 per cent of bilateral facial paralysis. It is also diagnostic challenge which, unlike unilateral facial paralysis, it is can be difficult to recognize because of a lack of facial asymmetry.

Bilateral simultaneous facial paralysis is described as facial paralysis involving both sides of the face occurring within four weeks of each other, and is found in 0.3-2 per cent of facial paralysis. The etiologies of bilateral facial paralysis range from infections, tumors, head injuries, degenerative diseases, vascular diseases, idiopathic. The most striking additions to the differential diagnosis of bilateral facial paralysis are Lyme disease (36%), most common etiology, Guillain-Barre syndrome (5%) and AIDS (0.9%). The common cause of bilateral facial paralysis is Lyme disease (36%), caused by borrelia burgdorferi, spirochete. Facial paralysis has been shown to occur in 11 per cent of patients with Lyme disease and is bilateral in 30 per cent of these patients. A diagnosis of a bilateral Bell's palsy (9%) should only be made after an exhaustive search for possible causes of the disorder have been excluded, which, is caused by viral infections, vasospasm, an autoimmune phenomenon. Guillain-Barre syndrome is thought to be a post-infectious viral inflammatory polyradiculo- neuritis. Bilateral facial palsy has been reported in 50% of patients with facial paralysis and may be the only clinical manifestation of Guillain-Barre syndrome.

About 5 per cent of all cases of facial paralysis results from head injuries. The temporal bone is affected in more than one third of basilar fractures. Whereas unilateral injury is commonly observed, bilateral temporal bone fractures are unusual. Temporal bone fracture is a well-known cause of facial paralysis, and is responsible for approximately 3 per cent of bilateral facial paralysis. Unfortunately, the early diagnosis of bilateral facial paralysis in the traumatic brain injury can be particularly challenging due to the severe nature of the injury, associated cognitive and affective deficits and other secondary complications.

In the diagnosis of bilateral facial paralysis, the most important aspect of the evaluation is a through history and a complete physical examination, including complete head and neck examination, complete neurological examination, Shirmer's test, electrodiagnostic tests. All patients with bilateral facial paralysis should perform through evaluations. Unilateral facial paralysis was usually idiopathic (i.e. Bell's palsy), whereas bilateral paralysis usually has an underlying pathology.

The efficacy of steroids remains controversial in patients with facial paralysis. But, steroids is usually administrated to patients with either traumatic or infectious facial paralysis. Steroids have been used to reduce edema, swelling and scar formation. Marginal benefit of steroid treatment in idiopathic facial paralysis is demonstrated in a randomized double blind controlled study. Also, An important management aspect of patient care is the prevention of exposure keratitis with the use of artificial tears and lubricants.

The prognosis for bilateral facial paralysis is dependent upon the underlying etiology. If the etiology can be identified and successfully managed, the prognosis is excellent.
